This directory (/test) will pass options to mocha
from the file mocha.opts. That file specifies what
directory mocha should look in to find the tests
it needs to run. We want to redirect to /client/test
because that is where our client side tests are located.

Mocha looks at test directory at project root 
by default for tests (or a mocha.opts file to 
redirect). This is why there is a test directory
at the project root
